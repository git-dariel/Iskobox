  paragraph1:
    "ㅤㅤㅤThe founding of Polytechnic University of the Philippines in Lopez, Quezon in February 1979 provided lots of opportunities among youths in the third and fourth district of Quezon and other nearby provinces.  This is evident by numerous successful alumni of the university in different fields.  In almost all offices both public and private in Quezon Province and elsewhere, we can see graduates of PUP Lopez occupying different positions. ",
  paragraph2:
    " The program initially offered were Bachelors in Accountancy, Business Management, Office Administration & Agribusiness Management.  Several years later other programs were offered to provide variety of options among students. With the increase of program offering, there was a concomitant increase in the number of enrollees making PUP Lopez one of the campuses in Southern Luzon with highest number of programs and enrollees. ",
  paragraph3: "With the advent of technology and inevitable trend towards computerization/ automation complimented by survey among students & coordination with concerned stakeholders, another program – Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) was offered during school year 2018.  The program attracted lots of student enrollees making it one of the most sought programs.",
  paragraph4: "Currently, the administration in collaboration with stakeholders are trying to level up the program’s laboratory equipment, revisit program curriculum, and enhance faculty capability in order to comply with what is required upon the program and ultimately produce best quality graduates.",
