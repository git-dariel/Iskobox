  paragraph1:
    'PUP Lopez was founded in the Fourth Congressional District of Quezon in 1979. Since then, it has always been aimed to become the leading Tertiary Institution in the community. Subsequently, in 2011, it started to embrace its goal to transform PUP Lopez into a Premiere University through productive institutional innovations and good governance. It anchored its bow and arrow on exploratory to experimental yet gainful activities. It also opened its doors to outside stakeholders who can help the University, and offered additional relevant academic programs with the objective of helping the youths achieve their dreams. At present, the Lopez Campus continues to play a role in improving the lives of the youth and their families and help in nation building.',
