Yumul, Sr., donated the site and the school buildings with all the facilities therein. There was one concrete three-storey building with 21 classrooms and another two-storey building made of wood, which housed the library, the faculty rooms and administrative offices. The site with total land area of 23,724 square meters is located at Yumul St., Brgy. Del Pilar (now Brgy. Burgos), Lopez, Quezon.",
